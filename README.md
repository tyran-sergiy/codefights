# Codefights

CodeFights is about improving your coding skills by solving programming challenges. You can do this in a number of different ways:

- random VS fights: you're paired up against another random CodeFighter for a 3-round fight
- friendly VS fights: you challenge (or accept a challenge from) a friend, best of 3 rounds
- Bots and CodeBots: automated opponents that you can challenge to 3 round fights
- Challenges: you solve more difficult programming problems and try to get the shortest solution
- Tourneys: you get matched up against multiple opponents at once

When Codefighting, you'll see one of the following challenge formats:

-Debugging: find and fix the bug in the existing code as quickly as you can
-Recovery: fill in the missing code to complete the function
-Codewriting: implement a function by writing the code from scratch
