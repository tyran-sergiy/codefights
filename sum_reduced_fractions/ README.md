##### Implement a function that can sum two [reduced fractions](http://www.math.com/school/subject1/images/S1U4L2ex.gif) and produce a new one. 
#
#
#
#### example
#
For  `A = [3, 5]` and `B = [7, 5]`  the output should be `fractionSum(A, B) = [2, 1]`
`3 / 5 + 7 / 5 = 10 / 5 = 2 / 1` , so the answer is `[2, 1]`.
